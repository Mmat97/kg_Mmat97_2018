# kg_Mmat97_2018
Determine whether a one-to-one character mapping exists from one string, s1, 
to another string, s2. 


## Ver 1.0
Uses mainly sets. Coded so that "foo" is confirmed to not be isomorphic to "bar" but "bar" is to "foo". 



## Advantages
1. Set is implemented as a hash table so lookup is O(1)
2. Checks the pairs while using sets to get take into account repeating characters.
